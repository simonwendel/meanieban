ngAnnotate does not support using the pattern _SomeServiceName_ although support for this outside of tests is
in the AngularJS injection service. For fun, this patch adds the underscores option to ngAnnotate.

The patch is available as source code from:
https://github.com/simonwendel/ng-annotate/tree/feature-underscores
